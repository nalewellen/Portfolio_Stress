# The Data

```{r ticks, echo=FALSE}

ticks <- tibble(Tickers = c("BAC","JPM","WFC", "AAPL", "MSFT","GOOG","NEE", "DUK",
                            "AMZN", "DIS", "PG", "KO", "XOM", "CVX", "JNJ", "UNH",
                            "BA", "MMM", "VZ", "T", "DWDP", "MON"), 
                Sector = c("Financials", "Financials", "Financials",

kable(ticks, caption = "Tickers by Sector in Portfolio Stress Models", align=c(rep('c',times=2)))
```



```{r model_data, echo=FALSE}

model_data <- read_csv("final data set.csv")

kable(head(model_data), caption = "Tickers by Sector in Portfolio Stress Models")
```



# Models

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
